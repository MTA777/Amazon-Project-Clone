#### Video Demo: <URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_nMQ2r5SmY>

#### Description:

I created an E-commerce website using React,firebase,Express and many libararies for front-end.
It includes all the CRUD operatoions.Also includes all the pages of Log-in, Log-out, Registrartion
, Home page, Checkout page and many-more.
There are hard-coded number of products in the database and in future,
if we want to increase it, we can do it easily by manipulating the database.
Amazon Clone is a clone of Amazon.com, the world's largest online retailer. It is a complete E-commerce website, created by using technologies like react, firebase, express and other technologies. It has all the features of Amazon.com and it is very easy to use.

This is an e-commerce website that I created for my school project. It has all the features that Amazon has, with a few more features. The site also includes a blog section where I post about my latest blog posts and what's going on in my life.

In this project, I tried to implement all the CRUD operations from Firebase.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
